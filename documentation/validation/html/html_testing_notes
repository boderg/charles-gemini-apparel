Html checking summary - 

all add, edit and selection pages have a warning 'no header' - this is because of django templating to access the dynamic page titles {{ page_title }}

all selection pages have an error 'bad value for attribute action' in the delete form - this is because of django templating to access urls - specifically {{ delete_url }}
